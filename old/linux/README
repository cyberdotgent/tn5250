tn5250 linux/README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains installation and configuration instructions and notes
specific to the Linux platform.

The linux console only defines F1-F20 by default.  I have included a sample
map file which has all the function keys.  It also has a modified definiton
for the tab key to allow the use of Shift-Tab to move backwards through
fields.  It is based on the stock linux
console.  To make use of the file, you need to use the loadkeys command.  As
the root user, type the following:

   loadkeys us5250.map (or uk5250.map if you have that keyboard)

The above is not necessary if you are only going to use the emlator in an
xterm. After doing this, all the function keys will now return unique 
codes.  One caveat is that this will effect all of your consoles.  Also, the 
change is only temporary, so you will have to invoke it again unless you put 
it in a startup file somewhere.

In addition to the map file you also need to make sure that the terminfo
file that you are using is properly set up.  In particular, it needs to have
definitions for all 24 function keys, and it must have the proper code for
back tab.  To look at the current contents of your terminfo, use the infocmp
command to dump them to a file.  After making any necessary changes, you can
recompile the file with the tic command.  For details please see the man
pages for those commands.  There is a file called 5250.terminfo which shows
the what I use.  To add this terminfo entry, type the following as root:

   tic  5250.terminfo

Now all you need to do is set your TERM environment variable to 5250 (or
xterm-5250 if you are using X-Windows).
